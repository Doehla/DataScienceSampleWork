Collection of various data science projects for demonstrations.

## Projects
### Image Detection
#### Building footprints
##### Approach
* CNN

##### Data
###### Considerations
We are making use of geographic information, which has two main ways of thinking about it:
* Raster data
  * Image pixel data, for example satellite images.
* Vector data
  * collection of points, lines, and polygons containing the information.

###### Data Sets
* Makes use of the following data sets:
  * [Microsoft's Canadian Building Footprints data](https://github.com/Microsoft/CanadianBuildingFootprints) (Open Database License, info [here](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/))
